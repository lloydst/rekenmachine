# collection of calculators
- angularjs
- html
- jquery

## node
node is only used to serve the 3 calculators with express on 3 diferent ports:
- html:         localhost:3000
- jquery:       localhost:3001
- angularjs:    localhost:3002

but this isnt required (since all the links are relative). It is possible to double click on the index.html files in their respective folders
